# Thera Bank Personal Loan Campaign 

### Project Data Description: 
The dataset contains  data  on  5000  customers.  The  data  include  customer  demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account,  etc.),  and the  customer  response to  the  last  personal  loan  campaign  (Personal  Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign

### <u>Domain:</u>
Banking

### <u>Context:</u>
This case is about a bank (TheraBank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its  liability  customers  to  personal  loan  customers  (while  retaining  them  as  depositors).  A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over  9% success.  This  has  encouraged  the  retail  marketing  department  to  devise  campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.
